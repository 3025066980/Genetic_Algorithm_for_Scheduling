Genetic Algorithm for Solving Software Project Scheduling Problems
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
That genetic algorithm obtains the data of the problem regarding the tasks and the employees of the project. In this process it groups the tasks through an evolutionary strategy. The outcome provides a solution with the corresponding cost and duration of the project tasks within their given constraints.
