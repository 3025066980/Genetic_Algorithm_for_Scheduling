Genetic Algorithm for Solving Software Project Scheduling Problems
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

That genetic algorithm obtains the data of the problem regarding the tasks and the employees of the project. In the process it groups the activities through an evolutionary strategy. The outcome provides a solution with the corresponding cost and duration of the project activities within their given constraints.
